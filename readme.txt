Welcome to COVIDMonitor v1.0!

I am a simple CLI program that will allow you to get a glimpse of what is happening in a country during this challenging time. Use the following commands:

newCases => use this to see the new cases in a country in a user-selected interval
totalCases => use this to know the total cases till date in a country
top => use this to list the top n countries (n is selected by the user)
highestAge => use this to know the age group most hit in a country
lowestAge => use this to know the age group least hit in a country
status => to know if a country is in a steep-up, a steep-down or a peak

When you want to check out another country, just type: changeCountry

To exit the program, type: !exit

Please note that all commands are cases-sensitive and a country's first letter should be capitalised(e.g: Egypt not egypt)

Stay safe!
